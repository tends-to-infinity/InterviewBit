# InterviewBit
This repository is a collection of my gists solutions in C++ language. 

## Notes:
- Sometimes, multiple solutions/approaches have been provided with relevant comments in the solution file, 
these are being continuously updated as and when I find a more optimized solution. Be wary of copying two solutions separated
by comments simultaneously to run/submit on InterviewBit's online judge. Both shall work individually.
- I've used C++11 ([list initialization](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/list_initialization), 
[auto](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/auto), 
[emplace_back](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/emplace_back/), etc) features
in each and every solution.
- The solutions also succinctly encompasses years of C++ industry programming experience and care has been taken
to optimize even at the slightest visible portions of the code.
- *The code in this repo is completely original content and written by me.* If you like what you see, don't forget to show your liking by :star:ing this repo.

## How to contribute?
1. Fork the repository 
2. Do the desired changes (add/delete/modify) 
3. Make sure you've followed the existing coding standards and pattern of pasting the entire problem statement with a link to the problem on [InterviewBit]
4. Make a pull request 

## When should you contribute?
- If your solution's time complexity :alarm_clock: is better than the solution already present *or*,
- If your solution's space complexity :floppy_disk: is better than the solution already present *or*,
- If your solution is of the same time *and* space complexity but is more concise :page_with_curl:. 
In this case, comment out the original solution & make a pull request with your solution *or*,
- If your solution is of the same time *and* space complexity but is easier/more readable :page_facing_up: to understand *or*,
- If you use the same solution as present in the main branch and have gone the extra mile to add short comments :memo: 
explaining what's happening or what's the rationale at that particular code line, wherever necessa
